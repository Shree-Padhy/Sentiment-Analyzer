very bad experience food is not good but the price will always high not good for searching good restaurant i dont recommend this ,-1
one of the best food and atmosphere you can experience,1
service is not good very late service foods are not available,-1
light is dim for clicking photoes other wise nice place,1
worst experience till date in berhampur the staffs dont know how to behave and serve to their customers and we ordered at pm and till  no dinner was served   no glass and no forks and spoon  the staffs denied that they dont ,-1
we waited for  mins for the order and got to knew later that they didnt expect such crowd coming in on a sunday evening pathetic service coming in for the st time,-1

very good,1
"decent food at berhampurprobably one of the best service around here the staff is extremely good and adept

"this is good place to have dinner with family
pros its an ac restaurant the quality of the food is good
cons its a bit expensive compared to other restaurants the room is a bit dark theyll serve the food late",1
good taste for chinese and non veg lovers indian cuisine is bit okayish although being exorbitant a few of the serving people seemed annoying but the guard seemed showstopper,1
a very good example of a very bad restaurant   i wish that i can give this place zero stars only go here if you have at least two hours to wastesave your money and do not eat here,1
ambience is good   food i tried here twice but honestly my rating is  out of  for food i felt ok ok kinda good for family and friends hangouts,1

food taste is good price is also reasonable staff are also good and responsive many times i liked the calmness maintained inside here,1
it was a very good restaurant though it was a bit more expensive it has maintained the price but the quality has fell off the cliff very bad experience as of december ,-1
this is a multicuisine restaurant if u love chinese food then this one is a great choice  staff behavior is good  they suggested me this drink n it was awesome to taste  ,1

in the veg we ate tandoori panner and panner crisp in starter

one of the best cafes in berhampur with good food and ambience prices are reasonable and the environment is warm,1
good cafe with very good service i got  off for students discount decor of the cafe was nice servers are efficient polite and good,1
an overpriced one compared to other cafes in berhampur good for only one time visit you can find better cafes at a budget price near that area,1
great place peaceful free wifi and good food very good customer service,1
we went to the cafe at around  pm the staff and the lady owner were sitting idle no one bothered to welcome us no one told us where to sit the tables were dirty they cleaned it  minutes after we entered ,-1
food was literally bad and it was just disgusting we ordered a chicken wings there was blood cells in it  and the  cheese burst garlic bread there was no garlic butter  cheese burst was just a dream in there overall i dont like the food but the ambiance is good,-1

we visited your cafe for a birthday party on october   around  pm we kindly request you to review your pos system and cctv footage the quality of the iced coffee and the honeycoated french fries was disappointing ,1
i had my birthday party therend they surprised me with two mini pastry which made me feel so specialbut one thing disappointed me food delivery was too time consumingstaff were soo friendly soo it doesnt matterssomehow i felt good ,1
on reply to my previous review they told theres a cctv surveillance where they are tracking the behaviour of the customer how much time they wait how many items they eati would highly recommend you to hire a normal human being to taste ,1
we visited the place late evening and ordered a burger veg wrap pasta and a club sandwich french fries were served complimentary with most of the items the burger was not up to mark however the club sandwich and pasta was awesome,1
please dont order pizza  from this hotel  before sometime we ordered a pizza on zomato and we got a west  pizza and this message for zomato also ,1

"nice place to seat and have coffee or food
ambiance is

some of the food preparation was great and some others were average but the best thing was courteous service and the ambiance not too loud music but subtle also subtle lights ,1
i would leave zero stars if i could sleepy service poor food quality the ambiance is good the food was not very good quality and was overpriced but staff behaviour was good again the food is not worth waiting for,1
overall experience is good but food could be better fish and chips french fries was good but fish fries was bit more batter coated and less fish in there,1
i dont know how is the place please go and decide,1
best caffe better than arra caffee,1

"lovely place i had a great time the service was great 
ambience is nice best place to relax and enjoy a cup of tea or coffee if youre a coffee lover do visit ",1
their food is really the worst and when we give true review the owner asks the bill of my name  as if the person who has the bill of their name only had the food  and the bill was with name rupsha reddy do check  no doubt the interior was good but the customer service and their response to review shows why they are lacking behind ,1
tasty but costly above expected,-1

too costly for middle class peoples like usi never expect a half biriyani cost can be  rupeesoverall it was a very weard experience the staff were also not that much familiar  they also dont provide any menu card and bill receipt  ,1
one of the best chicken pakodas available here they are so soft n yummy with the chilli sauce mutton curry with roti is also superb egg pudding is also yummy ,1
its overrated  however the pakoda was not bad but i didnt like other things  i had lunch there  its extremely crowded and difficult to find seats by yourself which is normal there,-1
"definitely quick service and great food

hint of south indian to our odia cuisine ",1
love the chicken pakoda and caramel pudding of this place its simply delicious must try,1
the famed girija restaurant lives up to its expectations one of the best chicken pakoras one can find anywhere the chutney along with the pakoras is to die for the methi korma and chicken curry were very nice aswell ended the meal with a sweet and simple pudding which was very light and subtly flavoured,1
