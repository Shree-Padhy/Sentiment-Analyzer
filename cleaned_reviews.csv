though not located in a clean locality the ambiance inside the restaurant looks decent offers decent portion of good food but has very limited seating which might lead to sharing tables with others

great restaurant with very beautiful interior design though its a bit small but u will enjoy the food here sitting arrangement and lighting are excellent food is also very tasty and reasonable too staffs are very cooperative also recommended for family couple and friends this place us great for photography u will love it

nothing extraordinary as per the hypemeat was fully cooked in mutton and chicken biriyanis and  biriyani quantity is enough for  peoplebut it was blandprawns chatpata was good as a starter but  little in quantity palm chicken was good â¦

today i have parcelled chicken mughlai  and found  to  rubber bands inside the curry when i opened the parcel basic quality check missing would never recommend
today i visited bombay kitchen that waiter has imposed to take chicken wings then i ordered  chicken wing and  chicken biryani chicken wings are so roasted those are unable to eat on billing they charged  rupees against  rupees â¦
the outlook of this shop is excellentthe test is also good once i took fried rice parcel to home that are destroyed or arises bad small but the bombay kitchen to do not accept the zomato or swiggy order the behaviour of personality of waiter is good
"i had chicken fry biriyani n chicken muglai
taste was so good i will highly recommend you
quantity was good for one person dinner "
extremely disappointed with my experience we were commissioned to design a menu for this restaurant owner poured our time and creativity into it only to be blocked and ghosted without payment unprofessional and disrespectful would not recommend working with them
we are going there after a lot of researchthe starter item was good which was written in the black board out side of the the restaurant that was prawan octopus rs  and chicken kabab  but the mixed fried rice was hilarious bakwas
food quality is excellent  very good service
food was tasty but ambience on weekends are rush and jam packed the sitting format is such that you have to share table with others no privacy or separate table you will get no  seater or  seater tables available all are  seater sharing ones
fine dine restro in the cityprompt service and pretty good ambiencei would really give spc mention to chicken biryani and thier naanmust trymutton homestyle was very yummysuggested by them  good locationeasy to dine der after shopping in the nearby markets
it is excellent resturentthe items are  very tasty and delicious with actual order service is also well  spices are in  perfect ratio 
tried chicken kabab and baby corn in starter it seems lack of experience in preparing these dishes biryani  mutton and chicken curries were tried as well but none of them were cooked properly or taste didnât impress us i donât recommend anyone to this restaurant washroom is dirty can ruin your mood
waste of time and money thought to try biriyani it was worst taste and pieces were burnt to hide the smell stale food
ordered biriani mutton and chicken all were cold and not by its claimed standard needs improvement in cleaning and service as well
the food is not good at all the chicken had gone stale and was smelling we changed it twice and got the same thing  disgusting ð¤¢ â¦
worst experience the waiter will not take any order that you ask instead will give some random dish i asked for prawn soup was given chicken soup and he said there are prawn in it then confessed we dont have prawn today â¦
"good food ð nd taste was also great
nd budget is fine i mean its not that high food was worth the price do visit with ur family friends or ur partner â¦"
very good service food is also superb
food was really delicious and it definitely comes to the middle ground on pricing the only problem is that of seating which is expected given such a small place but its nothing unacceptable overall really good place for lunch
"the food is tasty but cant be justified with the price and quality usually it  is over crowded and dont have an calm ambience to dine in
dishes are often not cleaned properly â¦"
i guess its the best place to eat in berhampur really tasty food and very good service but its a real busy place so either u have to pre book or else u have to wait for ur turn in the restaurant
food is best both the quality and quantity and the inside looking and service is good
very bad type of food quality moton kima biriyani like dog food and lalipop properly not cookedthis type of quality
food was fantasticðbut there is one demerit ðyou have to wait for  mins to enter the restaurantð â¦
tried the chicken biriyani and chicken pakoda biriyani rice is good but the pieces were very big even for biriyani pakoda was awesome taste wise but a little less quantity wise
awesome food but need to improve service

the food served here is very good the dishes are so tasty and delightful they serve what is written in the menu ie they serve you what you expect the dish would be almost every dish served tastes awesome they have dine in and a function hall for around  people you should do give a visit to this place
delicious taste well behaviour of staff neat and tidy space should be expanded lots of noise from surrounding table not a peaceful dinner space but the decoration and lighting are very attractive
worst experience ever poor food quality
"worst 
if anyone looking for a restaurant in berhampur
this should be the last option"
food is good ambience is average menu is good but many items are unavailable on week days billing is inaccurate we had to point out multiple mistakes in the bill and they then corrected it
"amazing restaurant with good service and amazing food 
friends and family restaurant
i personally like biryani here n their lemon coriander soup  â¦"
i had a disappointing lunch experience where the service staff initially claimed to offer a wide variety of menu options but we ended up waiting for  minutes only to be informed that they were actually out of several items
food is tasty but the space is very small compare to the no of customers sometimes its very irritating when people wait for lunch or dinner because of crowd over there for eating but u can enjoy the delicious food here without any doubt
a nice and descent restaurant with low prices a small happening place  they have a function hall for  people food quality is goodserved fast located in park street  backside of gandhi park ample parking space available in the lane

the chicken biryani is the best in town the food the ambience just takes you away for a while one of the best and must try restaurant in berhampur the waiters are very professional and friendly
nice place  i like the wall painting its saying eating is necessary but cooking is an art and lastly the items are tasty

nice hospitality good dishes
good option for non vegetarians in berhampur taste hygiene service ambience biryani was not spicy so kids enjoyed it we ordered kali mirch chicken kebab and tangdi both tasted good but felt they had same masala burnt garlic soup was great rotis and chilli chicken masala was not bad
seating and interior of the restaurant was good but not satisfied with food
worst experience ever  food doesnt taste that good as hyped they dont even  have any online payment method in such pandemic situation the staffs are mannerless the way they treat  feels like they are serving us for free there are far better restaurant options available nearby
must try its biriyani  ð â¦
"great ambiance
good service
good food â¦"
bombay kitchen is considered as the best restaurant which offers spicy south indian food two outlets one is at railway station road and another is at park street one should prefer these two restaurants for a family outing and these are located at a very convenient place have a delicious bite thank you
awful and pathetic firstly over and overcrowded secondly poor gentry not suitable for family thirdly people were eating pathetically throwing bones of nonveg everywhere on the table directly and on the floor as well and creating a mess food was good though
previously it was very good i think die to pandemic the expert chefs are not there i cant say food is not ok but not like before reasonable pricing good quantity request to bring the taste back
priceless memories creator restaurant 
good taste and quantity under the best price available in berhampur but theres a lot of rush in the evening time and you might wait for some time for your food parking may be a problem as theres no parking facility provided by the restaurant

taste is not so good
this place is good for tasty meals but the pricing is too high low prices are written on the menu but they take too much money at the time of billing so first ask the price and then only order
the food here is just wow you will never regret coming here dining the only drawback is you may have to wait a little longer as the place is always on demand

best chicken kadai i have ever had so far would be better if it was located at roadside in stead of somewhere in a narrow street

both quantity and quality was not good staff arrogance was too much they were more focused on cricket than customer service
one of the best food place in berhampur meets quality

one of the best food and atmosphere you can experience

probably the best restaurant in berhampur good taste fresh food and nice ambience have been going there since a long time they have evolved but have maintained their dark theme
"this is good place to have dinner with family
pros itâs an ac restaurant the quality of the food is good
cons itâs a bit expensive compared to other restaurants the room is a bit dark theyâll serve the food late"
good taste for chinese and non veg lovers indian cuisine is bit okayish although being exorbitant a few of the serving people seemed annoying but the guard seemed showstopper
a very good example of a very bad restaurantâ   i wish that i can give this place zero stars only go here if you have at least two hours to wasteâªsave your money and do not eat hereâªâªâªâª
ambience is good   food i tried here twice but honestly my rating is  out of  for food i felt ok ok kinda good for family and friends hangouts

i ordered mutton biryani but staff parceled white with mutton  piece this is very ridiculous
here taste of the food is ok but it is very expensive it is not affordable for middle classit takes more extra charges also for normal drinking water
nice place to dine
nice place to boozing along with friends ambiance is good  parking of four wheeler is an issue weekend to crowded working days service is also better one of the best family restaurant in berhampur
nice experience you can get every delicious food here but it takes some time
interior and the service was really good the food was very delicious highly recommend to try seafood items and non veg items
food was great and tasy this restaurant look premium and have delicious food but due to heavy rush you have to wait to get a table
food is tasty value for moneylittle bit crowded on weekendsyou have to go before or book table early for conveniencebut its cozy n food is delcious
food quality and taste is delicious  just need to improve the serving time
food taste is good price is also reasonable staff are also good and responsive many times i liked the calmness maintained inside here
it was a very good restaurant though it was a bit more expensive it has maintained the price but the quality has fell off the cliff very bad experience as of december 
this is a multicuisine restaurant if u love chinese food then this one is a great choice  staff behavior is good  they suggested me this drink n it was awesome to taste ðð â¦

never order for any item of crab the cookchef doesnât know the cooking process other items ok bathroom hand wash diluted with water i donât understand why these peoples are doing like this spending lot on other but this small thing they are least concerned
good food
very less time taken to serve with good taste
very nice place good service good atmosphere but  price is higher then as compared to quality of food
worst food taste poor service genuine rating rest depends on your taste bud
the food and service are exceptional  we were asked to try out their specialty the tandoori crab we were not disappointed one of the servers saw me struggling with the crab and offered to crack it open i didnt have to ask these small things make a big difference highly recommended
great place to eat with your familybehaviour of staffs was really appreciable
very good ambience and nice quality food

visited on the day of inauguration the food was good and the price was reasonable ð â¦
this place is very goodbudget friendly with tasty food my fav although its my favorite since day one but i must say veg food here is also super yummy today we tried simple curd rice bali mushroom and simple tawafry mixed veg it was yummiest most recommended

food is very good and excellent taste with reasonable price best in berhampur
delicious paneer tikka wish to try more ðð â¦
behaviour off staff is not appriciable charging item price twice the market value ambiance is not good my first and last visit was just ok you would find better option in market
"a completely family restaurant
you must try ghee roast mutton biryani
chicken banjara kabab  â¦"
horrible service and food beware you may trapped with dish name chinese pakoda they charge freeking rs actual value as per ingredients not more than rs my first and last visit
"place is clean sitting arrangement is nice staff is friendly and good
food is just ok not that tasty but can give it a try we tried dal fry and panner butter masala masalas were on a bit higher side"
nice and prompt service food is good host is very understanding he listened to my instructions and didnt hesitate to serve in my car as i am with my family and didnt want to go to resturant for food nice and clean resturant
not good behaviour towards customer they sell the heavy rate chinese chicken pakoda  which price is  rupee and also biryani  was not that much good not satisfied with their service
great place good food reasonably priced on the highway so easy access to avoid the crowd of the city separate cottages being set up a new place but definitely recommended with family
bad food taste absolute waste the mutton kasa was drowning in oil with no good pieces and when some juice was asked he served some stinking masala jhol which was awful rather than some actual mutton gravy
"really the food was awesome as we went there had veg and non veg both
in the veg we ate tandoori panner and panner crisp in starter
in non veg my friends ate tandoori prawn and chicken crisp streek as starters â¦"
we have wide selection for nonveg dishes but for veg its very limited here if u want to opt for only nonveg u can go here blindly can hangout we friends nice place good parking space
the best thing i had noticed about this place is their behavior and service towards their customers today i have tasted mutton handichicken kabab and their pudinwhich were flawlesspersonally i would recommend this place for their best quality and generous quantity of foods at a reasonable pricejust value for money
previously i had good experience at this place but yesterday ie on th of october  i had miserable experience regarding hygiene and quality of product they use â¦
nice hotel with testy and range of choice in  food available family environment  party type space also available like large group one time setting at same table  hotel easily can be found at adjecent of nh 
the taste of all the dishes was the same i didnt find a difference
my favorite place i am loving it
have visited many times because of the taste and service  the manager  is friendly and the  atmosphere is good
not so customer friendlystaffs are demcare and unprofessionalfood is ok wont say good
the restaurant is overally good but yes the interior is not upto the mark price is affordable i will definitely suggest to go this place if anyone wants to visit a restaurant with a mid value price
very bad service and they do fraud with their customers and charge high price for other states person
nice dhaba with spicy food biriyani is good with raita staff behaviour also good you can eat with your friends and family
impressed with the hospitality and tasty food
the food tastes good but the service is not at all good the servers are not even able to understand what we say
food is amazing and surprisingly cost effective for such delicious food service is too good  satisfaction

"this was our quick halt on our road trip from bhubaneswar to srikakulam

worst food ever eaten in my life tasteless biriyanipalau oil nd masala â¦"
delicious crab curry the crabs were humongous and the preparation was good spicy i had ordered one muglai crab and another  homestyle crab curry both were very nicely prepared
thanks for the food best i had in berhampur tried paneer tikkaawesome paneer kurma was also very delectable not at all spicy full of flavours perfect for my taste buds and stomach too to end the masala soda was mind blowing
cleanliness is very bad else this restaurant is a must to try
this place is great food is pretty good and for their prices itâs  worth itdo yourself a favor and visit this lovely restaurant
you will not get the taste of any dish you wont like that food
"looking for good food
damn the food is extremely tasty the aroma of food is highly appreciable just stop on the way to to have some high quality food  recommended"
crab curry was expensive compared to other hotelsit was tasteless and size was small enough for the priceit was not even warm not recommended to order
this dhaba  was a worst nightmare for us   give you parcel of someone elses food one day we ordered a parcel of a curry chana masala instead of chana masala they gave us some egg cury  how can they do this too careless behaviour check once before you order something
it offers delicious food at very competitive price
"good hygenic and tasty food veg and nonveg items both are just wonderfully
any day recommended"
food is goodservice is good they will suggest the food and also make it as per preference santos and shambhu are both friendly and are keen on customer satisfaction

"a parcel can be enough for  persons
food was good but the rice was not cooked completely"
a bit off city on the high way food is good service is also good there is also a parking spot more sort of a dhaba than a restaurant but its a good place
good ambient super workers super cook kabab items lajawab but little bit high price good tastes i recommend this dhaba for foodies
the food is nice but some items are costly it is a dine in on nh and good place to eat
nonveg items are totally wrost mutton handi mutton  not boiled correctlyand  golden chicken is exactly this type
simply overpriced no taste self advertising egg tadka taste was horrible
very prepared food good quality and very taste loved it
if you want to experience real taste then just step in to new samrat dhaba you will get humble staff and genuine price
staff behavior is very good and best chinese food and indian thali meals given at berhampur ankuli bypass
good food reasonable price quick and friendly service perfect setting for a highway food stop

their food is really the worst and when we give true review the owner asks the bill of my name  as if the person who has the bill of their name only had the food  and the bill was with name rupsha reddy do check  no doubt the interior was good but the customer service and their response to review shows why they are lacking behind 
tasty but costly above expected

price is haigh compare to other hotel taste is also ok not that much goog very congestive place had breakfast there i will prefer not to visit again there
mustly try dosa  this hotel is best for dosa  but samosa taste not well   highly recomended  only for dosa and rasgulla 
try different varieties of dosa and veg biryani here too delicious
tasty food i felt a bit expensive rest is nice
very bad test   dont visit     this is very bad  test in berhampur
"breakfast and tiffins tastes good
must try 
 any butter masala dosa â¦"
it was one of the popular south indian tiffin hotel however its business growth is not so satisfactory over the years it has compromised with its quality and taste in a stiff competitive hotel industry with its peers it has to improve quality food and upgrade its hotel infrastructure
very bad experience i ordered rawa dosa but it was served  unproperly cooked and not in presentable condition
"previously its south indian food was so yummy and as compared to other restaurant that time a can give him  star
but presently quality and taste of food need to improve more
i also gave my feedback to owner during in my last visit"
"it was my good experience as compair with dalama restaurant
berhampur dalama restaurant charges me rs but food they serve cold even after complaining twice to owenr â¦"
at first glance you wouldnt want to go to this hotel but trust me the the taste of breakfast is way better than most of the hotel in berhampur i tried you rawa masala dosa and masala upma both were delicious must try one disadvantage is it has bit less space for sitting
here u can try the butter masala dosa
i love the currychatnisambarbada that i was served but rawa dosa was ok type  sitting arrangement is a little congested
very bad taste of veg biryani the biryani was allmost expired
a very famous hotel for tiffin the food offered here are very delicious yes the butter dosa is its most liked dish other dishes are also delicious it is situated at sanabazar though it is a small hotel but quality wise superb
the food here was so delecious as it wete in my childhood daysthe taste is something thats getting tastier as day passes byyou must try its tiffin and luch dishes once in your life time when youre in brahampur ð¥°ð¥° â¦
it was a small space area but the food was delicious and worth waiting for panner dosa and the malai sweet â¤ï¸
the food tastes good but ensure to check your order properly before you leave the rush usually leads to confusion and you end up getting less than what you paid for
very good food
one of the best tiffin hotels of berhampur dosa available in this hotel is of best quality however the space inside hotel is a bit narrow to dine

too costly for middle class peoples like usi never expect a half biriyani cost can be  rupeesoverall it was a very weard experience the staff were also not that much familiar  they also dont provide any menu card and bill receipt ððð â¦
one of the best chicken pakodas available hereâ¦ they are so soft n yummy with the chilli sauce mutton curry with roti is also superb egg pudding is also yummy â¦
itâs overrated  however the pakoda was not bad but i didnât like other things  i had lunch there  itâs extremely crowded and difficult to find seats by yourself which is normal there
"definitely quick service and great food

hint of south indian to our odia cuisine â¦"
love the chicken pakoda and caramel pudding of this place its simply delicious must try
the famed girija restaurant lives up to its expectations one of the best chicken pakoras one can find anywhere the chutney along with the pakoras is to die for the methi korma and chicken curry were very nice aswell ended the meal with a sweet and simple pudding which was very light and subtly flavoured
