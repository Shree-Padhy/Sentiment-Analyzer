3,Siva Krishna Kota,One of the best chicken pakodas available here… they are so soft n yummy with the chilli sauce. Mutton curry with roti is also superb. Egg pudding is also yummy. …,11 months ago
4,Purnima Pantomath,It’s overrated ! However the pakoda was not bad but I didn’t like other things . I had lunch there . It’s extremely crowded and difficult to find seats by yourself which is normal there.,8 months ago

6,Dr_SSP,Love the chicken pakoda and caramel pudding of this place. Its simply delicious. Must try,9 months ago
7,Ishit Nayak,"The famed Girija restaurant, lives up to its expectations. One of the best Chicken pakoras one can find anywhere. The chutney along with the pakoras is to die for. The methi korma and Chicken curry were very nice as-well. Ended the meal with a sweet and simple pudding which was very light and subtly flavoured.",a year ago
